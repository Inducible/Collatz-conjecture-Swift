# Collatz-conjecture-Swift
The Collatz conjecture in Swift.

Made for https://github.com/HAV0X1014/Collatz-in-every-language

An official Fent production: https://discord.gg/4sMGGZ6bSX

You can play with this project using https://www.onlineide.pro/playground/swift but outputs will be VERY limmited which sucks due to all the debugging output this software gives.

How to build (Windows only, you could likely build it for any Unix-like OS with ease):
```
 CD "(path to project folder)"
 swiftc Collatz.swift -o Collatz.exe
 ```
