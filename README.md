The Collatz conjecture in Swift.

Made for https://github.com/HAV0X1014/Collatz-in-every-language

An official Fent production: https://discord.gg/4sMGGZ6bSX

You can play with this project using https://www.onlineide.pro/playground/swift but outputs will be VERY limmited which sucks due to all the debugging output this software gives.
